    <center><h2><b><u>SULTANPUR LODHI</u></b></h2></center>
    <b><h3>Sultanpur Lodhi is a historic city in the Kapurthala district of Punjab, India, renowned for its deep spiritual significance in Sikhism.  Situated along the banks of the Kali Bein rivulet, the city is closely associated with Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism, who spent over 14 years here and attained enlightenment at this very location.  

Historical Background

Originally known as Sarwmanpur, Sultanpur Lodhi was a prominent center for Hinduism and Buddhism from the 1st to the 6th century.  It is believed that the Buddhist text Abhinav-Prastava was authored here by Katiyana in the 8th century.  The city faced destruction during Mahmud of Ghazni's invasion in the 11th century but was later rebuilt in the 12th century by Sultan Khan.  In 1443, Bahlul Lodi, the future Sultan of Delhi, renamed it Sultanpur Lodhi.  

Religious Significance

Sultanpur Lodhi holds immense importance in Sikhism.  Guru Nanak Dev Ji lived here for nearly 15 years, during which he meditated by the Kali Bein and delivered his first spiritual discourse after reemerging from the rivulet, proclaiming, "All Religions Are Equal."  </h3></b>
